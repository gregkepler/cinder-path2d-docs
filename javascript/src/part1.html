                <p>A <d dox="ci::Path2d">Path2D</d> instance is constructed of points and <d dox="cinder::Path2d::SegmentType

                <p>A point refers to points where a line segment connects starts and ends as well as handles that define the curve of the path.</p>
                <p>A segment refers to the line segment as defined by the points and handles. The types of segments are: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>MOVETO</strong>: Consists of a single point to start or continue your drawing from. Every path must start with a MOVETO segment.</li>
                        <li><strong>LINETO</strong>: Consists of a single point which contructs a line from the previous point</li>
                        <li><strong>QUADTO</strong>: A quadratic bezier curve consisting of 1 central handle point and 1 end point</li>
                        <li><strong>CUBICTO</strong>: A cubic bezier curve consisting of one handle point that controls the curve from the previous point and one handle point controlling the curve going into the given end point.</li>
                        <li><strong>CLOSE</strong>: A line created between the first and last points of a path.</li>
                    </ul>
